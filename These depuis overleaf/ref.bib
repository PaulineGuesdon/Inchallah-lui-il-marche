	abstract = {The field of particle physics is in a peculiar state. The standard model of particle theory successfully describes every fundamental particle and force observed in laboratories, yet fails to explain properties of the universe such as the existence of dark matter, the amount of dark energy, and the preponderance of matter over antimatter. Huge experiments, of increasing scale and cost, continue to search for new particles and forces that might explain these phenomena. However, these frontiers also are explored in certain smaller, laboratory-scale “tabletop” experiments. This approach uses precision measurement techniques and devices from atomic, quantum, and condensed-matter physics to detect tiny signals due to new particles or forces. Discoveries in fundamental physics may well come first from small-scale experiments of this type.},

	abstract = {Over the past century, the molecular beam methods pioneered by Otto Stern have advanced our knowledge and understanding of the world enormously. Stern and his colleagues used these new techniques to measure the magnetic dipole moments of fundamental particles with results that challenged the prevailing ideas in fundamental physics at that time. Similarly, recent measurements of fundamental electric dipole moments challenge our present day theories of what lies beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Measurements of the electron’s electric dipole moment (eEDM) rely on the techniques invented by Stern and later developed by Rabi and Ramsey. We give a brief review of this historical development and the current status of eEDM measurements. These experiments, and many others, are likely to beneﬁt from ultracold molecules produced by laser cooling. We explain how laser cooling can be applied to molecules, review recent progress in this ﬁeld, and outline some eagerly anticipated applications.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11841},
	abstract = {The Standard Model cannot explain the dominance of matter over anti-matter in our universe. This imbalance indicates undiscovered physics that violates combined CP symmetry. Many extensions to the Standard Model seek to explain the imbalance by predicting the existence of new particles. Vacuum fluctuations of the fields associated with these new particles can interact with known particles and make small modifications to their properties; for example, particles which violate CP symmetry will induce an electric dipole moment of the electron (eEDM). The size of the induced eEDM is dependent on the masses of the new particles and their coupling to the Standard Model. To date, no eEDM has been detected, but increasingly precise measurements probe new physics with higher masses and weaker couplings. Here we present the most precise measurement yet of the eEDM using electrons confined inside molecular ions, subjected to a huge intra-molecular electric field, and evolving coherently for up to 3 s. Our result is consistent with zero and improves on the previous best upper bound by a factor \${\textbackslash}sim2.4\$. Our sensitivity to \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-19\}\$ eV shifts in molecular ions provides constraints on broad classes of new physics above \$10{\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$ eV, well beyond the direct reach of the LHC or any other near- or medium-term particle collider.},

To do this, we take advantage of the fact that, for a given total number of atoms, a smaller and denser cloud scatters less photons when the gas is optically thick. The method relies on making an ansatz on the cloud shape along the unresolved dimension(s), and on providing an additional information such as the total number of atoms. We demonstrate the method on {\textbackslash}textit\{in-situ\} absorption images of elongated 87Sr Fermi gases. We find significant non-linear corrections to the estimated size and local density of the cloud compared to a standard analysis. This allows us to recover an un-distorted longitudinal density profile, and to measure transverse sizes as small as one fourth of our imaging resolution. The ultimate limit of our method is the wavelength that is used for imaging.},

This work quantitatively explains the recently observed suppression of chemical reactions between two rotational states of fermionic KRb molecules confined in one-dimensional tubes with a weak lattice along the tubes [Yan et al., Nature 501, 521-525 (2013)]. New loss rate measurements performed for different lattice parameters but under controlled initial conditions allow us to show that the loss suppression is a consequence of the combined effects of lattice confinement and the continuous quantum Zeno effect. A key finding, relevant for generic strongly reactive systems, is that while a single-band theory can qualitatively describe the data, a quantitative analysis must include multiband effects. Accounting for these effects reduces the inferred molecule filling fraction by a factor of five. A rate equation can describe much of the data, but to properly reproduce the loss dynamics with a fixed filling fraction for all lattice parameters we develop a mean-field model and benchmark it with numerically exact time-dependent density matrix renormalization group calculations.},

We discuss the approach to stationarity of the model focusing in particular on the fate of interfaces between the two states; a simple classical model based on a membrane picture helps developing an effective hydrodynamic theory even if the dynamics does not feature any conserved quantity. The fact that the model reaches stationary properties on timescales that depend on the system size while the asymptotic decay rate is finite is duly highlighted. We point out the reasons for considering these exceptional stationary states as quantum many-body scars in the open system framework.},

	abstract = {Nuclear spin exchange occurs in ultracold collisions of fermionic alkaline-earth-like atoms due to a difference between s- and p-wave phase shifts. We study the use of an optical Feshbach resonance, excited on the \$\{\}{\textasciicircum}1S\_0 {\textbackslash}to \{\}{\textasciicircum}3P\_1\$ intercombination line of \$\{\}{\textasciicircum}\{171\}\$Yb, to affect a large modification of the s-wave scattering phase shift, and thereby optically mediate nuclear exchange forces. We perform a full multichannel calculation of the photoassociation resonances and wave functions and from these calculate the real and imaginary parts of the scattering length. As a figure of merit of this interaction, we estimate the fidelity to implement a \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{SWAP\}\$ entangling quantum logic gate for two atoms trapped in the same well of an optical lattice. For moderate parameters one can achieve a gate fidelity of \${\textbackslash}sim95\% \$ in a time of \${\textbackslash}sim 50 {\textbackslash}mu\$s.},

A previous mass-scaling model [Borkowski et al., Phys. Rev. A 90, 032713 (2014)] was able to incorporate a large number of photoassociation resonances for \${\textasciicircum}\{88\}\$Sr, but at the time only a handful of resonances close to the dissociation limit were known for \${\textasciicircum}\{84\}\$Sr and \${\textasciicircum}\{86\}\$Sr. In this work, we perform a more thorough measurement of \${\textasciicircum}\{84\}\$Sr and \${\textasciicircum}\{86\}\$Sr bound states, identifying multiple new resonances at deeper binding energies out to \$E/h=-5\$ GHz. We also identify several previously measured resonances that cannot be experimentally reproduced and provide alternative binding energies instead. With this improved spectrum, we develop a mass-scaled model that reproduces the observed binding energies of \${\textasciicircum}\{86\}\$Sr and \${\textasciicircum}\{88\}\$Sr to within 1 MHz. In order to accurately reproduce the deeper bound states, our model includes a second \$1\_u\$ channel and more faithfully reproduces the depth of the potential. As determined by the previous mass-scaling study, \${\textasciicircum}\{84\}\$Sr \$0\_u{\textasciicircum}+\$ levels are strongly perturbed by the avoided crossing between the \${\textasciicircum}1{\textbackslash}mathrm\{S\}\_0 + {\textbackslash}phantom\{ \}{\textasciicircum}3{\textbackslash}mathrm\{P\}\_1\$ \$0\_u{\textasciicircum}+\$ \$({\textasciicircum}3Π\_u)\$ and \${\textasciicircum}1{\textbackslash}mathrm\{S\}\_0 + {\textbackslash}phantom\{ \}{\textasciicircum}1{\textbackslash}mathrm\{D\}\_2\$ \$0\_u{\textasciicircum}+\$ \$({\textasciicircum}1Σ\_u{\textasciicircum}+)\$ potential curves and therefore are not included in this mass-scaled model, but are accurately reproduced using an isotope-specific model with slightly different quantum defect parameters. In addition, the optical lengths of the \${\textasciicircum}\{84\}\$Sr \$0\_u{\textasciicircum}+,{\textbackslash} ν=-2\$ to \$ν=-5\$ states are measured and compared to numerical estimates to characterize their use as optical Feshbach resonances.},

However, effectively exploiting the spin richness necessitates precise manipulation of spin populations, a challenge yet to be fully addressed in this class of atomic species. In this work, we present an all-optical method for deterministically controlling the spin composition of a dipolar bosonic erbium gas, based on a clock-like transition in the telecom window at 1299 nm. The atoms can be prepared in just a few tens of microseconds in any spin-state composition using a sequence of Rabi-pulse pairs, selectively coupling Zeeman sublevels of the ground state with those of the long-lived clock-like state. Finally, we demonstrate that this transition can also be used to create spin-selective light shifts, thus fully suppressing spin-exchange collisions. These experimental results unlock exciting possibilities for implementing advanced spin models in isolated, clean and fully controllable lattice systems.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate coherent manipulation of the nuclear degrees of freedom of ultracold ground-state strontium 87 atoms, thus providing a toolkit for fully exploiting the corresponding large Hilbert space as a quantum resource and for quantum simulation experiments with SU(N)-symmetric matter. By controlling the resonance conditions of Raman transitions with a tensor light shift, we can perform rotations within a restricted Hilbert space of two isolated spin states among the 2F+1 = 10 possible states. These manipulations correspond to engineering unitary operations deriving from generators of the SU(N) algebra beyond what can be done by simple spin precession. We present Ramsey interferometers involving an isolated pair of Zeeman states with no measurable decoherence after 3 seconds. We also demonstrate that one can harvest the large spin degrees of freedom as a qudit resource by implementing two interferometer schemes over four states. The first scheme senses in parallel multiple external fields acting on the atoms, and the second scheme simultaneously measures multiple observables of a collective atomic state - including non-commuting ones. Engineering unitary transformations of the large spin driven by other generators than the usual spin-F representation of the SU(2) group offers new possibilities from the point of view of quantum metrology and quantum many-body physics, notably for the quantum simulation of large-spin SU(N)-symmetric quantum magnetism with fermionic alkaline-earth atoms.},
